# PDB structures and ZDOCK predictions in C++ and Python

[libzdock](https://github.com/weng-lab/libzdock) implements a set of utilities and library functions to work with PDB files, and ZDOCK/M-ZDOCK output files. It can be used to perform transformations on PDB structures based on ZDOCK predictions, generate multimers from M-ZDOCK output, constraint based filtering, and pruning.

## Utilities

A number of small utilities are built by default, to facilitate basic operations on ZDOCK, M-ZDOCK and PDB files. Each tool is described briefly below.


### centroids
Generates a PDB file with HETATM records indicating the center of mass for the top-_N_ predictions in a ZDOCK output file.

**Usage**
```
usage: centroids [options] <zdock output>

  -n <integer>    number of centroids to generate (top-n) (defaults to 1; the top prediction)
  -l <filename>   ligand PDB filename; defaults to receptor in ZDOCK output
  -c <char>       chain id to use for output (defaults to 'Z')
```

The output looks like this:

```
HETATM    1 N    HOH Z   1      36.995  43.928  73.278  1.00  0.00           N
HETATM    2 N    HOH Z   2      30.233  44.599  71.103  1.00  0.00           N
HETATM    3 N    HOH Z   3      63.936  22.304  57.441  1.00  0.00           N
HETATM    4 N    HOH Z   4      63.456  20.526  57.747  1.00  0.00           N
HETATM    5 N    HOH Z   5      45.213  21.873  26.833  1.00  0.00           N
```


### constraints
Performs constraint based filtering on ZDOCK and M-ZDOCK output, i.e. based on
a minimum or maximum distance between atoms in the predicted complexes. Distance
constraints are specified in a constraints file, of which the format is described below.

  - The format is line-based and each line represents one constraint.
  - Each line is whitespace separated and contains the following columns:
    + Atom serial number in the _first_ structure
    + Atom name (and altLoc)
    + Residue name
    + chain id (exactly _one_ character)
    + residue sequence number
    + Atom serial number in the _second_ structure
    + Atom name (and altLoc)
    + Residue name
    + chain id (exactly _one_ character)
    + residue sequence number
    + the last column is optional and contains "MIN" or "MAX" indicating the type
      of the constraint; minimum or maximum distance. If not specified the default
      constraint type is "MAX".

For ZDOCK constraint based filtering, the two sets of columns refer to atoms in the first and
the second structure respectively, whereas for M-ZDOCK where only one structure is operated on,
boths sets of columns refer to the same single structure.

Example constraints file:
```
13 OE2 GLU A 5    101 OD1 ASP B 12 7.3  MIN
13 OE2 GLU A 5    201 O   GLU B 12 7.5
13 OE2 GLU A 5    234 CA  PRO B 12 20.0 MAX
```

**Usage**
```
usage: constraints [options] <zdock output> <constraints file>

  -r <filename>   receptor PDB filename; defaults to receptor in (M-)ZDOCK output
  -l <filename>   ligand PDB filename; defaults to ligand in ZDOCK output
```

### createlig
Creates a complex or transformed ligand for a ZDOCK prediction. Transformations are documented
[here](https://github.com/weng-lab/libpdb/blob/master/src/zdock/TransformLigand.hpp#L74).

**Usage**
```
usage: createlig [options] <zdock output>

  -n <integer>    index of prediction in ZDOCK file (defaults to 1; the top prediction)
  -c              create complex; by default only ligand is created
  -r <filename>   receptor PDB filename; defaults to receptor in ZDOCK output
  -l <filename>   ligand PDB filename; defaults to ligand in ZDOCK output
  -a              return all records (by default only ATOM and HETATM are returned)
```

### createmultimer
Creates a multimer complex (or a single component) from a M-ZDOCK output file. Relevant
transformations are documented
[here](https://github.com/weng-lab/libpdb/blob/master/src/zdock/TransformMultimer.hpp#L87).

**Usage**
```
usage: createmultimer [options] <zdock output>

  -n <integer>    index of prediction in M-ZDOCK file (defaults to 1; the top prediction)
  -r <filename>   receptor PDB filename; defaults to receptor in M-ZDOCK output
  -m <mer>        component of multimer to output (all if not specified)
  -a              return all records (by default only ATOM and HETATM are returned)
```

### pruning
Performs pruning on ZDOCK and M-ZDOCK output (using the greedy algorthm published here:

Hwang H, Vreven T, Pierce BG, Hung JH, Weng Z. (2010) **Performance of ZDOCK and ZRANK in CAPRI rounds 13-19** _Proteins 78(15):3104-3110_
([pubmed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20936681))

**Usage**
```
usage: pruning [options] <zdock output>

  -c <double>     cutoff RMSD (defaults to 16.00)
  -C              return all prediction, but with score replaced by
                  cluster number.
  -l <filename>   structure PDB filename; defaults to ligand in ZDOCK
```

### zdsplit
Splits a ZDOCK file into equally sized chunks, each retaining the original header (akin to UNIX' _split_)

**Usage**
```
usage: zdsplit [options] <zdock output>

  -n <integer>    chunk size (defaults to input size)
  -p <string>     output filename prefix (defaults to "zdsplit.")
```

### zdunsplit
Reconstitutes a ZDOCK file from multiple _chunks_ (akin to UNIX' _cat_).

**Usage**
```
usage: zdunsplit <zdock output> [file] [...]
```

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This library is partly based on libpdb++, obtained from [RBVI (UCSF)](http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Overview/software.html#pdbio). The existing code was updated to match the current PDB standard (there's still some work in progress here but the major record types are done). A wrapper class __PDB__ was created as a container for PDB records and to provide collections of __ATOM__ and __HETATM__ records as a _[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)_ matrix. The __PDB__ class supports PDB files with and without __MODELs__. The second part of this library provides classes to deal with __ZDOCK__ and __M-ZDOCK__ output files as well as distance constraints. Coordinate transformations have been implemented for both __ZDOCK__ and __M-ZDOCK__ predictions, see [here](https://github.com/weng-lab/libpdb/blob/master/src/zdock/TransformLigand.hpp#L90-L112) and [here](https://github.com/weng-lab/libpdb/blob/master/src/zdock/TransformMultimer.hpp#L99-L110) respectively. A number of executable programs are available for common tasks, such as creation of transformed ligand, complexes and multimers, the application of constraints as a post-processing method, calculation of centroids, pruning, etc.

BUILDING
--------

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/weng-lab/libzdock.git'
cd libzdock
git submodule update --init --recursive
make -j16
make test
```

The compiler (i.e. g++-7 or clang++) can be updated in the Makefile to reflect your system.


CONSTRAINT FILES
----------------

Constraint files are line based. Each line contains a distance constraint
(either minimum distance, or maximum distance) between two atoms in two
structures. For ZDOCK these represent the "receptor" and "ligand" stuctures
and for M-ZDOCK they refer to two atoms in the same structure.

The format whitespace separated and looks as follows:

```
13  OE2 GLU A   5    101  OD1 ASP b  12 7.3 MIN
13  OE2 GLU A   5    101  OD1 ASP b  12 7.5
```

* Column 1-5 represent:
  - ATOM/HETATM serial (integer)
  - ATOM name
  - Residue name
  - Chain identifier (exactly one character)
  - Residue sequence number
* Column 6-10 represent the second atom
* Column 11 contains the distance (double)
* Column 12 is optionally "MIN" or "MAX". If none is specified, "MAX" is assumed.

NAME
----

pdb++ − A C++ class for manipulating Brookhaven Protein DataBank records

SYNOPSIS
--------

```C++
#include <pdb++.h>

....

PDB record;

while (cin >> record) {
  switch (record.type()) {
    case PDB::ATOM:
      cout << record.atom.xyz[0] << ' ' << record.atom.xyz[0]
            << ' ' << record.atom.xyz[0] << endl;
      ....
      break;
  }
}
....
```

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The routines listed above are available in the pdb++ library,
*-L/usr/local/lib/midas -lpdb++*.

The **PDB** class provides methods for parsing Brookhaven Protein
DataBank (PDB) records (lines from a PDB file) into structures and
expanding those structures back into PDB records. Rather than provide
access functions for each possible field, the structure containing the
parsed record is publicly available. The field names are listed in the
header file.

The **PDB** class has two enhancements to the Brookhaven Protein
DataBank specification: four character residue names, and the PDBRUN set
of scene annotation records. Four character residue names work because
everywhere in the specification a three character residue name appears,
there is a blank afterwards.

MEMBER CONSTANTS
----------------

**BufLen**

The maximum length of a generated PDB record string (including the null
byte).

**PDBRUNVersion**

The default version of the PDBRUN scene annotation records.

There are also constants for each known PDB record type (*e.g.*,
**ATOM**, **HETATM**, *etc.*), and the constant **UNKNOWN** for an
unknown PDB record.

The following constants are for each PDBRUN scene annotation record
type: **USER\_PDBRUN**, **USER\_EYEPOS**, **USER\_ATPOS**,
**USER\_WINDOW**, **USER\_FOCUS**, **USER\_VIEWPORT**,
**USER\_BGCOLOR**, **USER\_ANGLE**, **USER\_DISTANCE**, **USER\_FILE**,
**USER\_MARKNAME**, **USER\_MARK**, **USER\_CNAME**, **USER\_COLOR**,
**USER\_RADIUS**, **USER\_OBJECT**, **USER\_ENDOBJ**, **USER\_CHAIN**,
**USER\_GFX\_BEGIN**, **USER\_GFX\_END**, **USER\_GFX\_COLOR**,
**USER\_GFX\_NORMAL**, **USER\_GFX\_VERTEX**, **USER\_GFX\_FONT**,
**USER\_GFX\_TEXTPOS**, and **USER\_GFX\_LABEL**.

The following constants are for the various graphics primitives
supported in scenes: **GFX\_UNKNOWN**, **GFX\_POINTS**,
**GFX\_MARKERS**, **GFX\_LINES**, **GFX\_LINE\_STRIP**,
**GFX\_LINE\_LOOP**, **GFX\_TRIANGLES**, **GFX\_TRIANGLE\_STRIP**,
**GFX\_TRIANGLE\_FAN**, **GFX\_QUADS**, **GFX\_QUAD\_STRIP**, and
**GFX\_POLYGON**.

MEMBER TYPES
------------

typedef char **Date**[10]

A text field containing a date, typically *day*−*month*−*year*, where
*day* is numeric, *month* is a three-letter abbreviation, and *year* is
the last two digits of the year.

typedef char **AName**[5]

A PDB atom name, *e.g.*, NO2\*.

typedef char **RName**[5]

Residue name, *e.g.*, ALA.

typedef char **PName**[5]

PDB name, *e.g.*, 9lyz.

typedef char **Id**[4]

Generic short id field.

typedef double **Real**

Size of floating point numbers read and written.

struct **Residue**

A **Residue** consists of a residue name (**name**), a chain identifier
(**chainId**), a sequence number (**seqNum**), and an insertion code
(**insertCode**).

MEMBER FUNCTIONS
----------------

**pdb**() **\
 pdb**(RecordType t) **\
 pdb**(const char \*buf)

Constructors. The first two above construct a zeroed instance of the
given record type (default **UNKNOWN**). The last constructor above
fills in all of the fields of the instance from the given PDB record
text.

RecordType **type**() const

Return the type of PDB instance.

void **type**(RecordType t)

Change the PDB record type of the instance and reinitialize all the
fields to default values (zero in all cases except for an **ATOM**’s
occupancy which defaults to 1.0).

const char \***chars**() const;

Return a string containing the PDB record in textual form.

static int **PdbrunInputVersion**()

Return the current PDBRUN scene annotation version used to parse text
records.

static int **PdbrunOutputVersion**()

Return the current PDBRUN scene annotation version used to create text
records.

static void **PdbrunInputVersion**(int v)

Set the current PDBRUN scene annotation version used to parse text
records.

static void **PdbrunOutputVersion**(int v)

Set the current PDBRUN scene annotation version used to create text
records.

static recordType **getType**(const char \*buf)

Return the PDB record type for the given line of text.

static GfxType **getGfxType**(const char \*buf)\
 static const char \***gfxChars**(GfxType gt)\
 static int **sscanf**(const char \*, const char \*, ...)

A version of **sscanf**(3) whose format’s behave like FORTRAN formats
where field widths are sacrosanct. If the input line is short, then the
rest of the fields are initialized to default values. Any literal
characters in the format must match the input. The format characters
are: space, ignore input character; **c**, character (array), default to
a space; **d**, integer, default zero; **f**, double, default zero;
**s**, get a C string, trailing spaces are stripped and it is null
terminated, default an empty string. **sscanf** returns the number of
input fields converted (may be less than expected if the input line is
short) or −1 if an error is found.

static int **sprintf**(char \*, const char \*, ...)

A version of **sprintf**(3) whose format’s behave like FORTRAN formats
where field widths are sacrosanct. Literal characters are copied as is.
If the text or number to be printed is larger than the given field
width, then the field is filled in with asterisks. The format characters
are: **d**, integer; **D**, integer where zero is written as spaces;
**s**, right-justified string (a negative field width left-justifies);
**c**, character (array), zero characters are converted to spaces;
**f**, floating point, normal **printf** precisions are used.

I/O FUNCTIONS
-------------

ostream &**operator\<\<**(ostream &s, const PDB &p)

Output the current PDB record on the given output stream.

istream &**operator\>\>**(istream &s, PDB &p)

Read a line from the given input stream and convert to a PDB record.

SEE ALSO
--------

Description,’’ Febuary 1992, Brookhaven National Laboratory, the January
1993 Protein Data Bank Quarterly Newsletter, ‘‘Annotating PDB Files with
Scene Information,’’ Gregory S. Couch, *et. al.*, (submitted for
publication).

NOTES
-----

The subtype field of USERxx structure tells what the *xx* part was. The
rest of the line, up to the card sequence portion, is the text field.

Due to the way Brookhaven encodes their files, atom names often have
leading blanks and sometimes have embedded blanks. Residue names
occasionally have leading blanks too. To be entirely consistent with the
PDB format, the programmer should put those blanks in before using the
**chars** member function.

BUGS
----

Routines are needed to convert to and from PDB typesetting conventions
in **COMPND**, **SOURCE**, **AUTHOR**, and **JRNL** records. Also, some
new record types have appeared since 1994, that currently show up as
**UNKNOWN**, such as **TITLE**.
